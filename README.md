# NC News

# Introduction

Created a full stack news app that replicates the functionalities found in a social news platform such as Reddit. Available to view at https://nc-cool-news.netlify.app (the website takes time to load as the api needs to wake up, your patience is appreciated ðŸ˜Š)

# Overview

This news application combined the news back-end api (found at https://github.com/Gurtajs/News-project) to create a full stack app where the user can:
- View all articles
- View an article by id
- View articles by topic
- Post comments 
- Like articles 
- Order articles by ascending or descending sorting by date posted, number of comments or votes
- - Delete articles
- I have dealt with error handling when the user searches for a non-existing path, article or topic an appropriate error message is displayed. The form to post the comment is also validated ensuring that the user does not post bad data.
